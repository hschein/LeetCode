# My LeetCode Solutions

## About This Repository
This repository contains my Python solutions to various LeetCode problems. I started this journey in May 2025 to sharpen my problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews. My goal is to build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms by consistently tackling a wide range of problems.

All solutions are written in Python, and each file includes comments explaining the approach, time complexity, and space complexity.
